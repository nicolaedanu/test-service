## This is the example of a project that i am working on

### Current scenario
Rest assured setup classes (TestBase and TestEnvironment), are present in each project.
We access the endpoints from the setup class.
 
### Desired scenario
Have a core-api project that stores TestBase and TestEnvironment (plus other generic util classes) 
and keep inside the project only the Tests classes and Endpoint class.

PS: If you have other advices about how to structure, i am open to suggestions.
